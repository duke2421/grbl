Added Support for a new Arduino-Nano-Shield designed by Till Nenz. You can find more information about his shield here on Github.

With GRBL you can use a Laser module easily with LaserGRBL or with Laserweb4. With Estlcam the Laser works not very well, so I decided to make a fork of the GRBL-Code, so that it can be used with Tills shield. If you not have this shield, use the [original GRBL code.](https://github.com/gnea/grbl)  
Output Pins D2 and D3 are now also working. 
I changed the config, to not use the Z axis for homing.  

Due to significant pin changes some functions of GRBL can not be used with the shield fom Till, so I removed the whole code for:

RESET      
FEED_HOLD     
CYCLE_START  
SAFETY_DOOR

These four functions are without function and Terminals E7 and E8 are not useable.
### You must not connect anything to these Pins!

The endstops at X, Y and Z are tested and working. Connect X Endstop to E1, Y Endstop to E2 and Z to E3. The Probe should be connected to E4, but this is not tested yet.

Updated to GRBL 1.1h, Autosqaure is not useable on the Tillboard!

Removed all lines of the original Readme, you can read it at the [original repo](https://github.com/gnea/grbl).
Because I haven't done anything big to the code, the Donate button will stay as it is and always point to gneas repo.

Grbl is an open-source project and fueled by the free-time of our intrepid administrators and altruistic users. If you'd like to donate, all proceeds will be used to help fund supporting hardware and testing equipment. Thank you!
